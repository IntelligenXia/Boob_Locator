# Boob Locator
Finds boobs in an image and encloses a bounding box with confidence probability


# Motivation
This is a simple implementation helping you to tag all your images for those containing boobs.( partially covered or fully exposed ) 
Please see the accuracy numbers to see the details.

# Disclaimer

This repository is intended for eductional purposes, and to allow people to contribute towards/improve the model's accuracy codebase. While we donot encourage the download of the whole repository and data for training, 
we do provide the option for it to be trained into a custom model that you can deploy locally.
See `prerequisites` for more information on training your own model.

## Built With

* Python/PyTorch
* Yolov5




## Prerequisites

* You will need to download the entire images(data) / labels(annotations) folder  ( This runs into GB's and is hosted in anonymous serers )
* You will need a powerful GPU and good healthy computer
* You might have to run the training process for a few hours ( almost 20 + hours ) depending on the GPU that you have.
* preferably an NVDIA GPU card 

## Dependencies

* see the requirements.txt file
